plz (pronounced "Please") is a dead-simple task runner written in Rust.

<!--truncate-->

It's a lightweight tool for consolidating and executing project-specific tasks.

Commands and variables are defined in a `yaml` file that's easy to read and write.

plz is cross-platform, and doesn't rely on a specific shell for execution.
